00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,380


2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,790


3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,160


4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,450
I was

00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,560

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,980
Talking to

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,080
Students

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,130


10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,860
There's a call comes out of the blue

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,370
This young guy wanted to know it's the technology was ready to be commercialized

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,450


13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,510
Lenny said the magic word

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,510
Awkward he says

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,730
I have

16
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,460
Access to some money that would allow us to

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,570
Let's get started

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,360
Okay

19
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,140


20
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,280


21
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,750
Where does the money originate

22
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,820
I need sub

23
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,250
I'm not a junior member at

24
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,940
That's a venture capital firm

25
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,200
I want to

26
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,820
To look up

27
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,050
What venture-capital mentally

28
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,390
Heard of it before

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,790


30
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,290


31
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:04,990


32
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,000


33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,030
Chris Burgess willing to risk everything

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,030
Street Fighter we didn't know we were doing Silicon Valley

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,030
Cisco flooring company

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,030
The rest is history I don't know how to write a business plan I can only tell you how we

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,030
I will you read them and we started the back and if the numbers are big we look at the front

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,690
Front see what kind of business it is

39
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,190


40
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,470
You have to look at the way conventional wisdom works and abandon it

41
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:54,700
No one has ever accused me of under-estimating

42
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,700
Myself

43
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,720


44
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,280
Jobs and Wozniak

45
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,410
Came up to see me

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,620
National Treasure

47
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,110
He is so visionary

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,630
And so bright

49
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,010
I had the fire ago

50
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,990


51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,400


52
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,340
These men didn't always wheel such influence in power

53
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,950
In the beginning

54
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,380
We barely knew what they were doing

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,500
50 years ago they were just young guys from modest means

56
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,100
Who thought they could help build Innovative companies

57
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,210
This is a story of a

58
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,810
12 man who stirred up a revolution in science and technology

59
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,130
Cuz they saw opportunity

60
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,500
Where others only song risk

61
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,570


62
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,390


63
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,960


64
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,140


65
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,050


66
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,490


67
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,140
Venture capital

68
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,880
I don't think I thought of it

69
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,670
First

70
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,530
But I don't know anyone use the term before I did

71
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,530
Back in the spring of 90

72
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,530
1957 Arthur Rock was just a junior Banker on Wall Street for then one day and

73
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,820
An unsolicited letter arrived at the office

74
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,830
The letter was unusual and no one else has brokerage firm knew what to do with it

75
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,880
It was a cry for help

76
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,290
Forever change the trajectory of Arthur rocks life

77
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,200
You got to be lucky

78
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,890
Everybody's can be lucky at some time or another

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,020
Thing I say is I was lucky day

80
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,850
He lucky early

81
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,590
The letter on Arthur rocks desk

82
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,050
I come from sinners in

83
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,640


84
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,210
A group of brilliant young men

85
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,240
Become known as the traitorous eight

86
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,500


87
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,090
We were young guys

88
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,760
Good bunch of young engineers and

89
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,350
And the scientists mostly

90
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,480
Working together to Shockley semiconductor

91
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,370
They were having a hard time with Shockley

92
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,290
And they were going to leave

93
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,710
It depends in deteriorated a chocolate lab

94
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,940
He was a very difficult person to work with

95
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,590
And a group of us started considering the possibility Lisa leaving so anyhow

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,740
Refrigerator

97
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,540
Does Prospectors news to introduce a group of senior scientists and engineers

98
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,600
Who have been working together it's Shockley semiconductor Laboratory

99
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,050
Cochlea just want to Nobel Prize

100
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,770
Was probably a little presumptuous others

101
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,530
I think we can push him aside

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,820
A group feeling a rose

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,820
To the effect that rather than leave one by one

104
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,620
Believe we are much more valuable to an employer as a group

105
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,260


106
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,490


107
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,460
Lease were

108
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,870
The resumes varies

109
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,470
Superior

110
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,520
Nice thought

111
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,490
Would you maybe there's something here

112
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,120
Something

113
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,620
More valuable than just to be an employee

114
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,370
Something that Arthur saw inspire

115
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,480
Fire him two step

116
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,140
How does ordinary roll is a Wall Street Banker

117
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,150
And that's when we met Arthur Rock

118
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,710
Arthur

119
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,470
Came out to meet with a group of us

120
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,820
And Arthur said

121
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,290
You want to start your own company I will find

122
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,850
Financing for you

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,550
So does this idea themselves nobody thought of starting their own company of those days

124
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,770
It was a new idea but it was a good one

125
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,850
At that time there was no Venture Capital so starting companies was new it wasn't of age

126
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,940
Innovative

127
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,400
Arthur Rock had to get creative about signing capital for the Traders 8

128
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,130


129
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,490
Is Bankhead contacts with Rich families at the Rockefellers in the Whitney's

130
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,020
But they weren't interested in backing a startup

131
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,770
All the way out in California

132
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,800
Made a list of companies

133
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,790
Exactly sat down with the Wall Street Journal

134
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:49,500
Looking for a company to ask to invest in these eight fellows in forming a new company

135
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,500
I think we have 35 companies

136
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:01,500


137
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:07,500
The attempt to start a new company might have ended then and there

138
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,240
With the traitorous eight returning to a job search

139
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,540
Arthur Rock admitting defeat

140
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,920
But then

141
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,370
Arthur received one last lead

142
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,350
We were pretty much at wit's end

143
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,460
And somebody suggested that I see your Sherman Fairchild

144
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,810
Sherman Fairchild

145
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,770
What's an entrepreneurial M self and also a very wealthy man

146
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,350
You right away shortly Pashto

147
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,020
Filippi's

148
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,810
And decided that

149
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,910
Fairchild

150
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,430
Cameron instrument

151
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,020
Would invest lie

152
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,460
Didn't half dollars we were looking for

153
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,160


154
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,970
Call myself The Accidental entrepreneur

155
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,600
With a 1.5 million Arthur raised the traitorous eight

156
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,630
Fairchild Semiconductor in Mountain View California

157
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,430
5 miles south of San Francisco

158
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,020


159
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,190
Fairchild was the first company to manufacture the sophisticated silicon chips

160
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,190
Ships that would power computers rockets and spacecraft Paving the way for

161
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,190
The high-tech AIDS in time the fruit orchards

162
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,970
Downing Fairchild

163
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,420
Which way to electronics companies

164
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,090
In the area would become famous as the Silicon Valley

165
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,560


166
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,180
Sand stayed together and formed

167
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,580
Fairchild semiconductor

168
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,120
Probably

169
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,520
Rapinoe silicon in Silicon Valley

170
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:45,010


171
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:51,010
Arthur rocket got Nets haste to something exciting insignificant

172
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,010
Wasn't the only one trying to figure out how to find young companies the road from Fairchild

173
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,790
Unfold businessmen were experimenting with their own version of venture-capital together

174
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,940
There were a group of us in San Francisco that used to get interested in small high-tech companies down the peninsula

175
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,400
There were

176
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,010
Take 5 listener

177
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,460
We all had jobs we

178
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,130
And other time her hands to we decide we just

179
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,810
We'll just make love together

180
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:37,580
We were just a bunch of young man in San Francisco who knew each other and respected each other what it was like was

181
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm very close

182
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,060
Fraternity I guess I can use that word

183
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,890
Carefully

184
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,320
Table of six or eight for lunch

185
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,290
None of us got enough money to do an investment by ourselves

186
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,140


187
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,370
We had to have help

188
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,310
It one of us ran across the

189
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,010
Entrepreneur who is trying to start a company with

190
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,070
Invite him up for lunch and after lunch with mask him to step out onto the street corner for a while

191
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,590


192
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,130
Give us 10 minutes and would make up our mind as to whether we wanted to invest in his company or not

193
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,570
I don't remember that

194
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,290
We didn't do that

195
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,470
We're too classy to do that that's a little bit quick I think

196
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,970
By the way

197
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,610
But I asked him to go get a cup of coffee

198
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,850
Two members of the group even more than gather round a lunch take

199
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,410
Every 6 weeks

200
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,520
In 1962

201
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,790
Draper

202
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,230
All their personal savings

203
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,030
Quit their day jobs to form a partnership and hit the streets

204
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,170
H & I

205
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,010
Each got a Pontiac least

206
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,710
And I am when a rat Henda knocked on doors and

207
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,300
If it sounded like

208
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,540
ABC Electronics

209
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,810
Then we go in after Presidency down and tell her

210
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,760
What are you doing what are you doing Venture tell what's that

211
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,740
My kids go to school what is your dad doing my dad's actually somebody as a firearm ID as a banker

212
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,910
And where's your dad you'll always Adventure capitalist

213
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,720
Damn you do actually you know

214
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,290


215
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,770
We were just stumbling around trying to figure out what to do

216
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,130
But we just knew that if we got involved with good people and good markets we could probably do over company

217
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:23,160
Growing companies create companies your helping to create something

218
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,410
Something for nothing

219
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,190
Existed before

220
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:32,320
And quite a large community got sustenance that wouldn't have existed unless you would gotten together

221
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,040
Together with this entrepreneur and his team and helped him

222
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,230
Along the way

223
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,060
Unscrupulous gambits a good formula

224
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,490
Everyone was sharing in the profits and success at these

225
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,470
Is Fletchling companies

226
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,530
Fairchild

227
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,970
It was a different story

228
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,870
Fairchild

229
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,340
Who was an imperfect

230
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,050
Vehicle

231
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,190


232
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,290
I joined

233
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,750
End of the 50

234
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,830


235
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,100
Part of the traitorous eight

236
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,090


237
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,490


238
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,220
Fairchild is owned by a corporation

239
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,410
An Eastman Corporation and the sense of division of equity

240
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,230
Was both unknown to them and repugnant

241
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,790


242
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,780
All of the East Coast companies

243
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,780
Had this

244
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,660
Hierarchy

245
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,430
They didn't understand

246
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,200
About

247
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,620
Shipping options to Aldi employees

248
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,300
The way west coast startups so if it to do

249
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,410
So the people in Fairchild

250
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,630
Including me

251
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,210
Are any kinds of significant ownership position

252
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,060


253
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,060
Then the early sixties

254
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,290
People began leaving Fair

255
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:57,860
Fairchild

256
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,500
To set up

257
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,290
Startups

258
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,170
And to begin to participate in what piece

259
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,710
What people

260
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,790
Correctly realize was

261
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,830
This was going to be something special

262
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,210


263
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,520
Meanwhile

264
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,230
Banker's desk New York

265
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,890
Well I'd wanted to do more of these

266
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,090
Venture Capital typed

267
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,910
The bunny was holding the east

268
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:24,810
And this

269
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,510
The scientist who would moved

270
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,450
From the East to the West

271
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,940
Cannoli ideas

272
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,140
So I saw a great opportunity and free

273
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,790
Bringing face cost money up

274
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,690
Stacking these people in other West Coast

275
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,080
Go West Young Man

276
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:47,620
In 1961 Arthur Rock raised $5000000 from East Coast investors

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,450

281
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,540

Hugely successful technology company

284
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,580
Silicon Valley Community of the 1960s

285
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,250
It was only a matter of time before

286
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,310
Before Arthur Rockwood once again cross paths with the traitorous eight

287
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,090


288
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,550


289
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,050


290

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,110
It's two most important founders

293
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,520
Remain loyal to their company until May of 1968

294
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,800
Fairchild

295
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,960
East Coast management metastable mistake

296
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,250
Logical internal candidate

00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,150
Do Visa next CEO

298
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,140
But they decided if we're going to look on the outside

299
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,220
Does that change the whole ball game

300
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,530
Noise filter

301
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,950
I'm going to leave are you interested

302
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,660

304
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,690


305
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,250
So I said okay

306
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,480
Let's do it

307
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,800


308
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,690
They need to expand and sing and they called me see whether I'd be interested

309
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,230
I came to be with no business plan

310
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,790
Other than what date

311
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,010
Verbally

312
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,370

314
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:37,970

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,810
We wrote A business plan it was one page

316
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,460
Double-spaced Neva set

317
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,640


318
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:54,000
I just says we were going to make things out of silicon and some interesting electronic devices

319
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,750
Oh I said general terms ever going to make memories

320
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,030
It has lots of typos and I do Bob type hurt himself

321
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,030
It's not a very profound document but it is really kind of cute

322
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,900
So how much money do you need

323
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,760
It makes it two and a half million dollars and I said okay

324
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:25,130
What percentage is a company do you think you'll be happy giving up for two and a half million dollars

00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,760


326
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,500
They thought so we'll help out a half

327
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,220
That's fine

328
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,470
And within a day and a half I can raise it to

329
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,290
Two and a half million dollars

330
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:45,340


331
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:51,340
Intel opened its doors in July of 68 and Arthur Ross Park

332
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,650
Partnership with its founders

333
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,900
Was only just beginning

334
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,370
Arthur was our chairman of the board in those days

335
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,310
It's been a lot of time there

336
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,860
Venture capitalist to write the check

337
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,910
Is that is an all we do

338
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,890
Writing a check is easy

339
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,260


340
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,560


341
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:20,660

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,400
Interviewed a lot of people all of pieces of Ameriprise

345
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,300
I just spoke with

346
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,130
What I consider common sense

347
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,590
Does a table

348
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,310

349
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,180
Gave us guidance

350
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:45,850


351
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,810
When not to go public as well as wendigo public

352
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,100
I was very involved

353
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:51,680


354
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,160
It was all due to Intel.

355
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,710
Wasn't do to me

356
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,960
We went public

357
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,320
The same day that play

358
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,290

359
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,220


360
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,480
At the same price

361
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,770
A few years later one of the analysts

362
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:13,940
The market has spoken this memories over memories 12:50

363
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,190


364
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,330


365
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,530


366
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:31,660


367
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:37,660


368
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,660


369
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,640


370
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,660
Shortly after Arthur Rock went out on his own

371
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,900
Profound

372
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,130
Young investment manager

373
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,060
Now that you would mr. Davis her

00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,400
We separate to find a younger partner do it all over again

375
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,450
And I said

376
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,420
I never

377
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,380
I mean with the light bulb

378
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,960


379
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,020
And I sat down and wrote him a long hand letter

380
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,870
And I never had ever done anything like this before

381
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,950
Probably Monday

382
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,700
I do telephone call mr. rocks on the line I said really

383
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,850
6 letter was very intriguing

384
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,660
He's just generally knowledgeable in on the same

385
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,680


386
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,040
Channel wish I was

387
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,980
And I found out later that there are over 1,000

388
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,460
The article

389
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,840
The Arthur had a handwriting expert

390
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,480
Analyze my letter

391
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,820
It's so deaf bunny so that's how I got an adventure business

392
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:12,890


393
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,280
Well you know there are no

394
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,650
Firm rules in the Venture Capital business

395
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,200
SEPTA there are no firm

396
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,890
No firm rules

397
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,510
Did you have any problems in convincing your colleagues

398
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,620


399
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,650
Yeah they thought I was out of my mind though

400
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,290
On this one

401
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,360
By the early 70s

402
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,730
Fired by the success were at The Rock

403
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,540
More members of the lunch group

404
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,000
Quit their day jobs and set up their own Venture funds

405
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,910
Read Dennis gave notice to his boss and American Express

406
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,010
You said are you sure that's what you want to do

407
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,190
I said Bill I've never been so sure of anything at all my life

408
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,970
Chevelle

409
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:54,000
We really don't want you to go but if you're determined to go you all to take some of our money with you

410
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,020
Laughs with gave us the impetus to start

411
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,270
Institutional Venture Associates

412
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,920


413
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,710
I potentially so profitable it was attracting people outside of Finance

414
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,290


415
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,430
Silicon Valley engineers

416
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:19,360
Eugene Kleiner Perkins form what would become one of the most successful Venture firms of all time

417
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,060


418
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,620
Well I started

419
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,240
Got into Venture Chapel by the back door

420
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,930
I was working for the Hewlett-Packard

421
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,750
When I had an idea for

422
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,480
Foray

423
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,800
Radically improve

424
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,630
And then I started the company

425
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,800
To manufacture the lasers

426
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,260
Worms all over I realized NE

427
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,150
I had been a venture capitalist

428
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,050
I put up the management

429
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:47,920


430
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,300
So then when I met Gene Kleiner who had

431
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,940
Left

432
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:52,820
Fairchild

433
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,740
We were both planning to go into the Venture Capital business

434
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,270
And we

435
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:05,290
Realize we complemented each other I mean I'm pretty intense in high strung and Gene was

436
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,800


437
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,350
Comonfort williams.az soothing Viennese accent

438
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,420


439
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,500
Eugene was just brilliant he was fun to be with

440
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,310


441
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,250
Murder once remodeled entrepreneur

442
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,360
And after you left us

443
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,530


444
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,240
You trust him

445
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,070
And Janine said

446
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,030
I would trust him

447
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,580
With my

448
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,840
My money

449
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,410


450
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,500
And that's how it started

451
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,320


452
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,840
We hung up our shingle

453
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,350
Nothing hat

454
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,640
The phone didn't ring we had a part-time secretary and we called out nobody called

455
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,870
Call them

456
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,860
We saw some deals

457
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,870
Then we did some deals

458
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,630
We lost money

459
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,220
In our original deal

460
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,010


461
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,780
I'll mention them even though they were very embarrassing

462
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,070
The most notorious in the maybe the fun

463
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,910
Was it coming coldsnow job which was the team to convert

464
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,960
Motorcycles into snowmobiles and

465
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,990
Which I actually worked and it was a lot of fun

466
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,980
One of the fuel crisis

467
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,170
Land is about the time we were ready

468
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,720
To go into production in

469
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,900
We couldn't get this to

470
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,660
Distributors

471
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,220


472
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,370
So Eugene and I thought you know this is not working

473
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,090
We've got to do something

474
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,040
Differently

475
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:33,860


476
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,200


477
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:43,260
Kalamazoo huge risk for clareburt

478
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:48,550
If Tim has failed up they would have never been a second Smiley forget Sivan

479
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,430


480
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,250


481
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,880


482
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,430
I think it was 33

483
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,210


484
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,310
That was young

485
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,200
Interns

486
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,990
People starting companies

487
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,430
But there weren't a lot of people starting companies

488
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,460
Ultimate reboot

489
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,080
Bruce smart guy

490
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,330
Very impressive

491
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,010
She had this idea Wichita

492
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,040
Not the technical Pro

493
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,650
Copart of apathy

494
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,290
Need

495
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,100
For a truly fault-tolerant computer

496
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,760
A computer

497
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,990
It would never fail

498
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,890
At that time for instance the

499
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,460
What's the New York Stock Exchange

500
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,010
I fell about

501
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,560
Everyday or every other day

502
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,650
And something would go wrong in it

503
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,600
It would destroy data

504
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,690


505
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,080
People knew the pro

506
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,870
The problem but they didn't have a solution

507
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,240
So just think of any credit checking Airline reservations pay

508
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:44,850
Banking

509
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,910
All Financial things on strip

510
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,010
All Communications

511
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,940
All kinds of thing

512
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,710
Or it's just not acceptable to have

513
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,130
The computer go down

514
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,820
We knew Tom and I knew

515
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,070
That if we could fill

516
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,660
Figure out a different kind of computer architecture

517
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,220
To solve this problem that we could create a big company

518
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,230


519
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,790
The problem was IBM

520
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,160
At 1 the Mainframe battle and 74

521
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,330
And

522
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,120
There was an article that said there would never be a new computer come

523
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,580
Never that was 74 and the

524
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,090
Cover was a picture of a short

525
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,400
And IBM was eating up here work company

526
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,060
When you think about

527
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,140
What

528
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,520
Decisions are being made

529
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,690
You got IV I'm wiping up GE

530
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,610
Siemens

531
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,010
So it would be easy not to want to go after that right

532
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,650
So you have to be brave

533
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,880
I mean you have to see it

534
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,050
And you have to be brave

535
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,550
And being brave is

536
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,230
One thing

537
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,200
You got to say about time

538
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,750
You got to look to get money from strong people because weak people don't invest into

539
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,500
Tough times

540
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,720


541
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,410
But that's when most of the big winners are created

542
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,630


543
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,440


544
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:10,680


545
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,610


546
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,480


547
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,870
Well first of all we didn't want to

548
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,480
Be the only backers

549
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,480
Backers of Tandem

550
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,390
We tried

551
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,110
To raise venture capital I made the trip back east

552
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,390
I remember

553
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,160
The first time we gave the pitch

554
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,610
Jimmy was

555
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,540
Straight out of

556
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,350
Texas

557
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,140
The real character

558
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,160
I didn't think you'd go over very well on Wall Street

559
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,730
He had to take any bus suit

560
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,730
He probably shared that

561
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,940
I'd literally took him to Brooks

562
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:39,880


563
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,060
Shoes socks the

564
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,710
He always say that

565
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,680
I forget what he said but

566
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,840
He could buy the suit but that still didn't help

567
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,570
Took it back

568
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,730
Wall Street in the Christophers thingy

569
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,780
That is not how I looked

570
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,610
I'm dressed

571
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,750


572
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,270
Tom was a

573
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,240
Hello more sophisticated than May

574
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:58,890


575
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,010
But we didn't get the money

576
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,320


577
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,860
Untried management

578
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,640
Unlikely idea

579
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,550
Most people

580
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,380
Would not have thought

581
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,000
Thought this was going to be a big winner

582
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,910
But I felt strongly enough about tannin

583
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,080


584
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,030
Even if we had to put up all of the money

585
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,070
We would do it

586
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,130
And then finally

587
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,390
Last minute

588
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,100
Johnson put in a small investment

589
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,150
I like to think that

590
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,850
Cub Scout my presence would be helpful in raising money elsewhere

591
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,750
It ratified our concept

592
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,700
I would credible in those days

593
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,810


594
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,870
I'm standing here next to a beautiful Tanner computer I think everyone recognizes this

595
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,590
Fine

596
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,180
Computer

597
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,040
Pittsburgh is a long time

598
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,460
Pick up that first order

599
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,800
The first customer

600
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,400
Was Citibank

601
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,420
When we got the first order and the computers

602
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,720
Performed as

603
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,530
Expected even better

604
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,220
The girls took off and became explosive

605
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,590
We went

606
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,980
725 fifteen hundred million two hundred million

607
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,810
Own up to a billion and we were fortune 500K

608
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,530
Company in

609
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:12,940
82

610
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,070


611
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,400
You use a tablet computer

612
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,520
Pretty much anytime you use your credit

613
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,110


614
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,910


615
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,020


616
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,310


617
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,810


618
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,340


619
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,410


620
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,630
When I started in the Venture business

621
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,000
It never occurred to me

622
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,980
That we would have multiple fun

623
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,070
Funds that Woody

624
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,130
Easily exceed a billion dollars

625
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,920


626
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,430
I got into the business somewhat fortuitously

627
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,200
When I

628
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,080
Made the decision

629
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,690
Decision

630
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,180
I had already put

631
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,620
Put in 13 years

632
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,720
Working in

633
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,670
Real companies

634
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,070
72

635
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,110
Don Valentine decided to train his connections

636
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,930
Semiconductor

637
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,610
Electric industry

638
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,210
In search of capital

639
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,210
To start a Venture van

640
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,560
We went to Steve

641
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,240
A guy at Solomon Brothers

642
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,880
And the said you know

643
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,650
I've listened to the pitch but

644
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,910
You didn't go to Harvard Business School

645
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,420


646
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,120
Guilty is

647
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,840
Is charged

648
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,710
Which is why you going to Business School

649
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,840
I said I went to Fairchild

650
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,490
Great business school

651
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,460
Startup company

652
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,470
Pioneer in a technology

653
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,340
Phenomenal leadership

654
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,450
Recognition

655
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,110
I said I don't need

656
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,180
To Business School

657
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,100
What I'm going to do

658
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,680


659
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,960


660
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,750
By Wall Street

661
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,700
Don Valentine found a mentor

662
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,130
Jenna Southern California mutual fund manager

663
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,110
Please take the money for Dawn's first

664
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:01,940
First Venture fund

665
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,150
I'm not interested in entrepreneurs

666
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,080
We'll do it our way

667
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,990
I'm not interested in entrepreneurs who think as a

668
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:11,830
The dress code

669
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,680
I'm interested in entrepreneurs who have a vision

670
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,280
Of doing something consequential

671
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,110
Preferably that becomes big

672
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:27,130


673
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:32,710
The most people that's something intimidating about the idea of interacting with a computer

674
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,890
But that is what's Happening Here

675
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,430
Atari

676
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,560
Had one of silicon Valley's absolutely larger-than-life personalities leading it

677
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,710
Nolan K Bushnell Bushnell with a young engineer

678
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:53,720
Working for game manufacturer cutting Associates when he decided to

679
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:59,720
The real thing that allowed me to start at re was I worked for nutting

680
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:05,720
And these guys couldn't find their butts with both hands I said you know I can run a company

681
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,950
And I won't make any of these things takes these idiots are doing

682
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,130
The first game Atari designed with

683
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,970
Took a prototype of the games

684
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,560
And placed it in a far

685
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:27,570
In Sunnyvale California morning customers were lined up outside clamor

686
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:33,570
A chance to play you put it on location turned a lot of money production

687
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,570
Directions sword in there seemed to be an insatiable appetite for the coin-operated game

688
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:45,570
From the outside batari look like a wildly successful company

689
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,170
Producing an endless stream of popular games

690
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,320
But there was one key Pro

691
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,420
Company was started with $250

692
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,750
And so we never had any money

693
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:07,890
If you're a hardware, you need a lot of capital for inventories the more successful

694
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,290
Successful the more you have to raise

695
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,280
Because

696
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,400
The more inventory you have the more customers or you're waiting to pay you

697
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,880
It takes a lot of capital

698
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,510
For hardware store.

699
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,170
In 1974

700
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:26,180
Pay for Atari was flirting with bankruptcy and desperately needed financial help

701
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:32,180
Nolan found the traditional channels off-limits

702
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,700
Traditional sense of things

703
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,710
Lend on acting spell do you have a house while give you a bargain do you have a car I'll give you a

704
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,710
Your loan on your car Nolan 10th no basis for a bank to be

705
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,400
Bank to be comfortable

706
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:55,610
I went through the factory and the smell of marijuana in

707
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,110
But I nearly knocked me to my knees

708
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,620
And I was

709
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,590
Gasping in

710
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,280
Coughing

711
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,550
Knows it what's the matter

712
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,920
I don't know what those people is smoking but it's not my brand

713
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:09,790


714
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,910
Passed on at REI

715
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,690


716
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,220
Surprising new products and development

717
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,050


718
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:23,060
Home pom Ataris engineers and discovered they can get the entire pop

719
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,080
Sounds the size of a shoebox

720
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:31,040
At the time playing video games at home for the Revolutionary concept

721
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,620


722
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,540
We showed on our play

723
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,140
Our plans for

724
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,260
Home games

725
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,430
He finally decided there was a business there

726
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,520


727
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,150
Giant market

728
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,230
He used to say you know the cleanup business you think it's big

729
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,080
This is you ain't seen nothing

730
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,510


731
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,070
Once we decide in 24

732
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,110
Refinance ettore

733
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,180
It was a matter of trying to fit

734
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:58,970
You figured out

735
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,200
Who else

736
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,460
Funds in those days

737
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,230
We're tiny

738
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,160
And in order for us

739
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,540
Start a company we have

740
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,520
To vary

741
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,870
Collegially

742
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,580
Together

743
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,940


744
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,640
I brought him other investors

745
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,410
How

746
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,170
It takes awhile to get you

747
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,160
Used to NOLA

748
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:27,650
And there's a story there about one of our meetings

749
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
For The Men Who Fidelity was sitting on

750
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,170
In a chair with his blue suit out of the rest of us were in the hot tub

751
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,230
Nolan was unrelentingly picking on him about his prudish Behavior he wouldn't get in the hot

752
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,000


753
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,740
With a controversial entrepreneur and no existing market for

754
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,880
Brown video games

755
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,950
Months went by the other investors remain on the fence about a tari

756
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,740
Himself took his home Punk

757
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,400
Prototype on the road in search of customers

758
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,390
Course we were young and felt that we could solve any problems came along and

759
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,720
You know selling and just

760
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,560
Toys R Us I can't be that hard

761
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,140


762
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,190
What then

763
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,890


764
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,090
I like to tell the story about

765
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,230
Taking the pong game to the toy fair in New York and selling nut

766
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,150
So we got let's try the

767
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,510
Television shops

768
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,200
And they didn't want it

769
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,820


770
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,750
These are very fragile companies with a lot of things missing

771
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,170
And the approach weeaboo is

772
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,530
Teaching is if we make this investment

773
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,120
Is a Rolodex

774
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,340
Strong enough to help these people

775
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,100


776
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,310
So much luck has interviews things

777
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,180


778
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,280
That without it

779
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,390
I think very few of us would have very many successes

780
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,270
One of our investors

781
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,390
Has a very big shareholder

782
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:07,040
Of Sears and they facilitated the introduction to the buyer at Sears

783
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,410
Where is who would buy a product like this

784
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,150
I think he was

785
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,480
Charms by Nolan and Faye

786
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,630
Found this Explorer

787
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,920
Experiment might be fun

788
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:22,080


789
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,000
Hong Kong hit the shelves

790
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,100
Just in time for the 1975 Christmas season

791
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:29,910
Of course

792
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,620
The rest was history

793
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:38,360


794
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:43,360


795
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,750


796
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,430


797
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,320


798
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,550


799
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,560


800
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,990
My father is a soul

801
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,690
Proprietor this little candy store

802
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,360
My father was a very Petty Union

803
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,090


804
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,530
Member dad

805
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,980
With a wonderful guy

806
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,450
Yeah and he really encouraged to self

807
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,810
Self-reliance

808
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,000
Little groceries little magazines

809
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,600
Ice cream

810
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,610
Cigarettes

811
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,690
Is a very early age to work there

812
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,300


813
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:37,200
I clerked I was six years of seven years old

814
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:37,820


815
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,590
Easier to explain who drove a truck

816
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,680
Then it is to explain what he didn't Union cuz I didn't understand what he didn't you and your other than fight with the head of the Union

817
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,180
And

818
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:58,640
We used to have a lot of arguments once I understood what a union wasn't and he could not

819
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,530
Couldn't understand why I was so adamantly opposed to the union

820
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,270


821
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,260
It probably

822
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,040
Has to do with money

823
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,870


824
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,620
Deep-seated sense of disappearance

825
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:17,700
When I was twelve or thirteen I was trying to figure out how to earn some money in the summertime

826
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,510
So I

827
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,860
Said no dad

828
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,390
Maybe

829
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,430
I could sell light bulbs

830
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,590
So I went down to the local Joe

831
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,590
General manager of the

832
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,390
Pennsylvania

833
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,500
Operation

834
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,200
You said your smallest amount that he could sell me would be

835
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,490
Kappa free carpool

836
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,590
Light bulbs

837
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,310
That's why I asked my mother if I could populate our

838
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,300
Basement with all these light bulbs

839
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,420
And I

840
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,860
So I got this wagon

841
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,640
Bigy they can run around and

842
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,440
Sold light bulbs for a whole summer time you called the bright point light bulb

843
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,250
It's a little bit over-the-top but that's what it was

844
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,820
I was a nerd

845
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,580
Highly motivated in patient-driven

846
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,510
Workaholic nerd

847
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,640


848
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,290
Who accidentally became an athlete

849
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,660


850
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,300
Got some sort of social polish

851
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,630
A school for nerds

852
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,100
A mighty

853
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,380
Scramble to get into

854
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,570
Pedigree where I thought I can earn a living which is electronic engineering

855
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,510
I did that for a while and I got us a pretty boring I can't

856
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,510
And I thought well I've heard about business school

857
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,970
Maybe I should take a crack at the

858
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,200


859
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,260
And this is where I got inspired by George dorio

860
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,360


861
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:43,830


862
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:49,650
Professor is George Doria with a father figure to a generation of young man at Harvard Business School

863
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,500
This French expatriate had the distinction starting the fur

864
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,430
The First Corporation dedicated exclusively

865
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,080
Exclusively

866
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,170
The Venture investing

867
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,440
American research and development

868
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,570
Founded in 1946

869
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,270
Ironically dorias lasting impact

870
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,010
Would not be through Ard

871
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,320
Which in its entire 25-year history made only one notable investment

872
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,510
Smoke important

873
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,520
Came to the spell he cast over his Harvard classroom

874
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,990
Dory was very controversial

875
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,910
Even at the time

876
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,730
At Harvard

877
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,730
Horse called Manufacturing

878
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,890
Really had nothing to do with Manufacturing

879
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,360
It was extremely popular course and it was all about

880
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,830
Starting companies

881
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,680
And Technology

882
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,760
We talked about on sprinters

883
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,330
Yet some of them must guests

884
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,920
What it was like to start a company

885
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,000
His lectures were

886
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:49,060
Dress on a drink she should have at a cocktail party

887
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,310
It was sort of George georgiou

888
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,610
Philosophy of life every year he take

889
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,420


890
00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:00,450
One whole session on how to read the New York Times

891
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,760
You should be able to meet this paper in 4 minutes

892
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,950
What did the first section IV

893
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,650
He said now the first thing you want to do is go to the obituary page

894
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,550
There you will learn

895
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,550
The wives that are important

896
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,860
Kind of life that you

897
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,220
Can build for yourself

898
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,050
You would talk about

899
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,830
Working with entrepreneurs and when

900
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:24,930
X gods

901
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,060
Tough as he always

902
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,430
And you made that point

903
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,400
That he would invite the ashburner over to his home

904
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,120
They have dinner and then you just sit him down in his library in

905
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,920
And play phonograph records of French marching music

906
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,680
And I'll just

907
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:49,010
You'll with the psychological wounds you know when he was talking about metric Apple starting companies he was as good as

908
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,510
Because he's only thing I understood that I bought it all

909
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,120
Blind singer

910
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:03,540


911
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:09,540
What do you mean

912
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:15,540


913
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:21,540


914
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:27,540


915
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:33,540


916
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,560


917
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,230
At the timer

918
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,950
Started to then take there was no such thing as genetic

919
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,980
Engineering

920
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,350
And to take my idea

921
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,750
Of commercializing

922
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:45,790
Gene splicing

923
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,090
The wrists were just

924
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:48,970
Anora

925
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,870
ISO Dwayne of what if

926
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,530
Goddard Arwen

927
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:57,630
Weather

928
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:58,880
Make a new life

929
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,670


930
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,410
It was a bet on technology

931
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,360
You looked at the value of the pharmaceutical industry

932
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,450
And if you had a better way

933
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,230
To develop drugs

934
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,940
The power was enormous

935
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,070
Nobody had a clue whether they could pull that off

936
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,180
But you did know

937
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,210
And if they could

938
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:28,300
It was big

939
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:35,100


940
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:35,600


941
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,160


942
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,520
It came

943
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:38,620
Out of the blue

944
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,270
Blue four

945
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,070
Food for me

946
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,450
I had not been

947
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,640
I've been thinking about

948
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,410
Starting a company

949
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,320
I thought I was going to die at the lab bench where the pie

950
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:50,950
NY milesplit

951
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:51,830


952
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,560
Bob called

953
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,770
He wanted to know it's the technology was ready to be commercialized

954
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,870


955
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:01,900
Bob Swanson

956
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,590
I think

957
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,210
It was the most appreciation

958
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,120
Individual I've ever met

959
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,120
Once you understood

960
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,870
What the potential technology was in genetic engineering

961
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,440
The whole

962
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,090
Way ahead of Antigua

963
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,800


964
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:21,250
Jim and I were looking around 4

965
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,350
Someone to add to the partnership

966
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,190
And

967
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,010
Bob's reminders

968
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,240
But there just wasn't enough go

969
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,470
What's going on I'm those days amazingly

970
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,430
To really have him full-time working on our Vengeance we don't have that many

971
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,860
But we were interested in doing something

972
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,530
In genetic engineering

973
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,090
We sorta sled

974
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,480
Go there find something new

975
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,870
If you can will finance it if you can

976
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,350
Three is motivated to find something

977
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:56,670
And he called Professor boyar the University of

978
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,110
Or is it I'll give you 5 minutes

979
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,660
Return in trigonal many hours

980
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,260
In those days

981
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:04,930
Funding for

982
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,730
Or research was

983
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:07,890
Difficult

984
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,660
Pencil

985
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,100
No I had some

986
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:16,990
Ulterior reasons for paying attention when he said he had money

987
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,300
Over the next couple of weeks

988
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,180
Swanson

989
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,630
Persuaded boyar

990
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,940
To take the idea of gene splicing

991
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,420
Intuitive some sort of commercial operation

992
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,520
Voyager 2

993
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,270


994
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,360
So are we go into

995
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,090
One of the

996
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:44,000
Are Embarcadero towers and we go up to the top floor

997
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,580
Floor

998
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:46,210
And

999
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,620
You can look out over the world

1000
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:56,790
It was something like out of a movie smoke

1001
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,050
Subway

1002
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,530
Stern looking guys are sitting there in a suit

1003
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,090


1004
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:10,620
Birkin says okay well what are you going to do what are you do what equipment do you need how do you know that you're

1005
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,050
How do you test

1006
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,400
Scary

1007
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,960
What are the risks

1008
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,130
Stoop germination

1009
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:22,140
Everything I could think here is this rich guy and all I'm talking to us about science and funding Sinai paid at

1010
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,790
At attention

1011
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:23,910


1012
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,770
And I didn't know anything about raising money

1013
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:32,780
Of course I knew nothing whatsoever about the technology I mean nobody I had to rely on it cuz it was so much too

1014
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,360
Much to be done he was a very Hands-On guy

1015
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,860
They wanted to raise

1016
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,540
About three million dollars

1017
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,880
To build the factory hire the people

1018
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,320
And then see if it would work

1019
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,530
But underlying at all

1020
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:47,610
Was the

1021
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,440
The tremendous risk factor of you know we would it be possible

1022
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,230


1023
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,390
Pure research

1024
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,570
Don't everybody knows if I

1025
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,070
Openly fun

1026
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,310
Pure research

1027
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,040
Somaya and everything is always been to try to

1028
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,230
Put the risk up front to get rid of the risk as fast as you possibly can

1029
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,140
Mom and I were very naive

1030
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,750
About how we were going to do what we did

1031
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,050
We changed

1032
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,030
Business plan

1033
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,990
I persuaded them to

1034
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:30,570
Do it a different way

1035
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:31,810
2

1036
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,570
Subcontract

1037
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,750
The experiment

1038
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:35,860


1039
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,670
Two different institutions

1040
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,500


1041
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,860
By subcontracting

1042
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,060
Tom Perkins eliminated the need to

1043
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,340
Dubai equipment filled elad fire staff

1044
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:51,310
The estimated $3000000 start up cost or reduced

1045
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,240
Touchet 250,000

1046
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,630
Kleiner Perkins put the money in Tech was in business

1047
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,100
Was Bob Swanson in a checkbook

1048
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,440
Sitting in our officer

1049
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,570
That was genetic

1050
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:06,330


1051
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,310


1052
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,570
Human insulin

1053
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,140
But to Tessa concept it begins a less complex or mode

1054
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,600
City of Hope Medical Center in Los Angeles would try to engineer jeans

1055
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,200


1056
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:27,700
UT San Francisco

1057
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,130
Pick an amount

1058
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:30,120


1059
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,370


1060
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,550
Afterbirth very long time City of Hope

1061
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:39,680
The nun we transported the Genies

1062
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:45,780
Bob headedness pocket up to University of California and her Boyer

1063
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,600
Inserted it into the

1064
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,630
Bacterial host

1065
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:55,650
It work so we had our

1066
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:01,650
Another breakthrough

1067
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,350
What was the first time in history

1068
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,540
Mankind that ever made an artificial

1069
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:08,840


1070
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:11,360
What looks to say an artificial bacteria

1071
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:17,660
Most doctors agree that genetic engineering will be the source of most drugs in the next decade

1072
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:23,660
Play Sia Myriad of products new vaccine we haven't scratched the surface yet in terms of

1073
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:29,660
New harmones and molecules that the body produces itself to keep itself healthy

1074
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,620


1075
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,630
And I wasn't my goal to start an industry my goal was to

1076
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,920
Make sure the science got translated into

1077
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:47,940
An Endeavor that would be used in all the things I've done I think I'm most proud of

1078
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:52,180
Talk because it's well saved

1079
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:58,190
Hundreds of thousands of people's lives

1080
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:04,190


1081
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:10,190
What is the great if you can make money and change the world for the better at the same time

1082
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:16,190


1083
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,330


1084
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:28,210
We are now entering our fourth generation of computers

1085
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:34,210
Difficult problems which one's required 30 hours of work by a computer as large as a house canal besaw

1086
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:38,660
I'll be solved in 12 seconds by a computer no bigger than a bathtub

1087
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:42,280
In 1976 the computer was about to get

1088
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:42,950
Personal

1089
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,340
Government

1090
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:47,090
Institutions and businesses

1091
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:48,210
Enter the home

1092
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,360
For venture capitalist

1093
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,810
This represented the opportunity of a lifetime

1094
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:58,810


1095
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,430
We turned on Apple computer we didn't we didn't even

1096
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,560
Turn it down we agree to meet with Joe

1097
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,880
Jobs and Wozniak

1098
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,400
Oh that would have been a fabulous and that's what if it made it

1099
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:14,920
But we didn't

1100
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,130
We should all know we're not real

1101
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,530
Really in that business

1102
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,030
Apple music computer helmet

1103
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:26,020
Recipes on it I sent my partner down to look at Apple

1104
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:29,210
He came back and he said the guy kept me waiting for an hour

1105
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,120
He's very arrogant

1106
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,580
Steve Jobs

1107
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,380
Jezebel

1108
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:36,820
Let's not to come

1109
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:38,900
That was big mistake

1110
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:39,970


1111
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,280


1112
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:42,860
In 1976

1113
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:48,910
The only people who believed in a personal computer with a sinks in nerds who gathered at Homebrew computer

1114
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,900
Computer clubs

1115
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,920
At 1 sex club twenty-one-year-old Steve Jobs had partnered with Steve Wozniak

1116
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,420
Create a circuit for kids called

1117
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:03,590
The Apple One Steve Jobs with working at REI

1118
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,160
The time

1119
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,290
Settlement office person to ask for start-up money was his boss Nolan Bushnell

1120
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:15,790
We needed an invalid then the Alchemy a third of a computer for $50,000 and I said

1121
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,240
I said cheat I don't think so

1122
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,350


1123
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,480
I could have owned

1124
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,350
The 3rd of Apple computer for $50,000

1125
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,290
Big mistake

1126
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,050


1127
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,480


1128
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,850
But I said call Don Valentine

1129
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,460


1130
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,440
Have high probability of senior opportunity

1131
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,880
So we had our meeting

1132
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:39,710


1133
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:45,650
I went to Steve's house and we talked and I was

1134
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,280
Convinced

1135
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:48,600
It was a

1136
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,330
Big Market

1137
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:51,990
Embryonically beginning

1138
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:58,310
He was in his Foo man Chu look

1139
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,140
And his question for me

1140
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,240
Tell me

1141
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,560
What I have to do to have you feel

1142
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,510
I said we have to have someone in the company

1143
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,440
Who has some sense of management

1144
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,530
And marketing and channels of distribution

1145
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,770
Send me three people

1146
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:22,220
I sent him three candidates one he didn't like

1147
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,080
One didn't like him

1148
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:31,410
The third one is Mike markkula my part will work for me I'm sure child

1149
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,980
Before he went to Intel

1150
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,940
He called me up and said there's two guys over on Los Altos today

1151
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,770
That. Capri

1152
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,920
Really use your help

1153
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:42,800
And you got to go see my souquet

1154
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,660
Cuz that's what I did on Mondays

1155
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,670


1156
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:48,750
I was retired

1157
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,680
I think I was

1158
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,800
32

1159
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,970
I retired

1160
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,050
Intel

1161
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,300
One day week

1162
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,270
I would help people start companies and write business plans

1163
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,350
I did it for free just from the interaction with bright people that have

1164
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,620
It has a lot of fire in her belly

1165
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,490
So I went over and talked to the boys

1166
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,360


1167
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:18,840
The two of them did not make a good impression on people who aren't they were bearded they didn't smell

1168
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,290
Smell good

1169
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,700
Pinterest funny

1170
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:22,700


1171
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:23,720
Naive

1172
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,600
Waze has designed a really wonderful

1173
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,340
Wonderful

1174
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:29,960
Computer

1175
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:36,330
Technology that was really Advanced the problem was

1176
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,600
You can walk down the street

1177
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:44,810
During 1976 and talk to 100 people say would you like a personal computer night go what's that

1178
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:50,780
And so I told him I said

1179
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,380
Write business plan

1180
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,860
So I got to working on it

1181
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,830
Gosh you know the opportunity here's just

1182
00:54:59,180 --> 00:54:59,750
To pray

1183
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,720


1184
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:06,110
The business plants ended with $142,000

1185
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,250
We could be cash flow positive

1186
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,410
Indictments

1187
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,480


1188
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:16,960
Came to the conclusion that we could build a Fortune 500 company in less than 5 years

1189
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:17,710


1190
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:22,110
I said I put up the money that was needed

1191
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:22,700


1192
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,840
How do you write a check

1193
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:26,250
Mike markkula.

1194
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:27,390
Came out of retirement

1195
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,390
The time in the president and CEO

1196
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,010
His first order of business

1197
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,390
Build a board of director

1198
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,850
In the first call he made

1199
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:37,030
What's the Arthur Rock

1200
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,310
Arthur would have missed

1201
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,840
Just at Woodward for Mike Martin

1202
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,850
Jobs and Wozniak came up to see me

1203
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,250
And they were very unappealing

1204
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,940
Goatee long hair

1205
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,690


1206
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:54,430
Mark Alyssa will before you make up your mind

1207
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,450
There's a

1208
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,390
Computer show

1209
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,880
And you would have come down and see what's going on

1210
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,290
And he did

1211
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,940
Something what happened he was

1212
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:04,810
Quite sure what

1213
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,060
There was a huge Auditorium

1214
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:09,260
And there was a spoof was

1215
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:10,760
Everybody

1216
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,780
Around it I couldn't even get next to it

1217
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,610
And it was the Apple booth

1218
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,300
And it turned out the

1219
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:17,310
Asherah

1220
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,650
Bain investment

1221
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:25,160
Then I got a call from Don Valentine this is I want to put the money in that cup I said okay you got to come on the board then

1222
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,220

00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:33,390
Arthur's

1225
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:39,770
Expertise comes from the way the Natural Markets work and how to choose people

1226
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:44,450
I don't think there's a company today because I could say that they had a better board

1227
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:45,720
And that

1228
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,850
We couldn't we kind of lose

1229
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:56,200
Take me to place alongside the venture capital

1230
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:56,860

1231
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,420
Was the young Steve Jobs

1232
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,740
I would never even seen the inside of a boardroom

1233
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:05,380
Those one board meeting that he took his shoes off and put

1234
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:06,700
Fairfield Vana

1235
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:07,570


1236

Put shoe back on and everything is fine

1241
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,110
He just needed some training in some direction some

1242
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,380


1243
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:27,650
Manners

1244
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:35,170


1245
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:35,830


1246
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,120


1247
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:42,990


1248
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:44,320


1249
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,680
You know in the Venture Capital business if

1250
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,030
200 deals and you

1251
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:55,070
You might do 10 of them and you will think they're all great

1252
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,200
And if one of them is great

1253
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:58,980
Then you're in the Hall of Fame

1254
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:05,080


1255
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:11,080


1256
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:16,760
If you make 10 deals you know

1257
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:23,110
If you do it well some of them going to succeed summer going to fail using one in there with all the Living Dead moving

1258
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:29,110
Leaving Jazz moving gears resume girls

1259

00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,440
Rafael for all kinds of reasons

1261
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:39,190
If it's

1262
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:45,260
Struggling to probation to give up

Admit defeat it's always traumatic you get personally involved in these companies

1264
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,210
Heartbroken

1265
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,340
Just to lose money

1266
00:58:54,490 --> 00:59:00,480
You losing money is not a good thing

1267
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:05,460


1268
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:07,840
Programs

1269
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,760

I can be recorded on floppy disks

1272
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,740
In the early 80s

1273
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:20,460
A new kind of company began to attract attention in Silicon Valley

1274
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:21,890

Doctor leaving Arthur

1285
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,740
An entrepreneur named Rob Campbell marched in

1286
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:49,320
I was out

1287
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,710
Always looking for money

1288
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,110
And I was

1289
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,440
Flying from Boston to

1290
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,610
And I was sitting in the back of the plane and the cheap seats were

1291
00:59:58,050 --> 00:59:59,250
Supposed to set

1292
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,000
And I noticed

1293
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:02,540
Half the people on the plane

1294
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,000
Had their briefcases open

1295
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,010
And they had

1296
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,430
Overhead transparencies and they were thumbing through them and they were

1297
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:11,420


1298
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,340


1299
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,230
That really was kind of

1300
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,680
The Genesis of why PowerPoint

1301
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,670
The way Rob is doing this

1302
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,070
And I was

1303
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,320
Really impressed with

1304
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,120
PowerPoint

1305
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,780
You seem shorter automated

1306
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,300
Very cumbersome process

1307
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,450
And when you see it

1308
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,540
Goes right through your bones

1309
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:33,800
So we started finding it

1310
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:38,160
Ceramics firm for by Rob Campbell company

1311
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,030
Forethought

1312
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,290
With an initial round of funding to develop this

1313
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,030
New stocks

1314
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,510


1315
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,240
The company was getting its venture capitalist

1316
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,200
Cause to worry

1317
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,370
Any new business

1318
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,650
Seldom does what's written in the business

1319
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:55,630
And we had

1320
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:56,990
A multitude of

1321
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:02,220
Limitations of the operating system once invested in trying to develop

1322
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:08,240
Engineering was delayed they were all far

1323
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:14,240
Largest distributor when in the chapter 7 of the bankruptcy

1324
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:18,760


1325
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:19,920


1326
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,570


1327
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,020
Approach

1328
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:24,550

1329
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:26,160
Looking for another infusion

1330
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,880
Rodkey manager presentation talked about FileMaker talk about what would

1331
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,700

1335
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:38,550
He didn't like it

1336
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:39,820
It ain't like

1337
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,540
Company

Lni

1340
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,560
My other partner got out of Inception

1341
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,250
Basically

1342
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,960
Yeah one product where you pay too much in a royalties

1343
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,940
And the other one which is not going to work so this isn't worth a dick for saying no

1344
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:54,810
And I said

1345
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:55,800
No more money

1346
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,180
No more money

1347
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,200


1348
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,500


1349
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,250
Despise Partners doubts

1350
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,010


1351
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:04,140
Wasn't ready to let pie

1352
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,910
Let PowerPoint go so easily

1353
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,480
My mother used to say don't ever underestimate that

1354
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,410
Cuz if he takes on challenge

1355
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,340
He's going to get it done

1356
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:17,540
Exceptional this presentation product is really a pretty good product

1357
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,680
Would you all mind if I did it myself

1358
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:23,940
And they said

1359
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:28,840
Will you can do what you want to do is knock over your conflict as long as we don't have to put any more money yet

1360
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,500
So I called

1361
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,180
My wife

1362
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,600
I said Pam

1363
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,610
Stop work in the house

1364
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,250
I said I'm going to fun

1365
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:38,530
Fun this company myself

1366
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:39,720


1367
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,470
We would never

1368
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:43,530
With dict

1369
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,420


1370
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:46,990
Potential problems of the venture

1371
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:48,690
Good if you have a

1372
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:49,820
Serious Pie

1373
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:50,670
Partner good pop

1374
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,330
Who's this

1375
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:52,980
I just do

1376
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,650
Just don't see this

1377
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,190
How can you proceed

1378
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:57,220
As a matter of policy we wouldn't

1379
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,180
Permit that Nar place

1380
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,130
We have permission

1381
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,230
Rubatino

1382
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,470
Really hurts

1383
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,090
PowerPoint

1384
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,580


1385
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:11,380


1386
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:12,270


1387
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,590
I remember telling dick I said dick

1388
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,750
You didn't make mistake

1389
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:22,860
I thought it would be a million-dollar product right out of the chute

1390
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:27,530
And instead of a billion dollars

1391
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,830
How does a shoot

1392
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,430
I think we got two and a half to three it was much better than what I hope for

1393
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,310
Yeah so I was

1394
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:38,070
Thinking this is enough to validate a public offering

1395
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,780
I think Jake would have liked us not to be a choir

1396
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:47,300
He said but you know we really don't have the structure in this company could be a public company

1397
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,580
You know I was nervous about access to Capital

1398
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,860
He said actually

1399
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,810
We've been approached by Microsoft

1400
01:03:54,350 --> 01:04:00,340
And they have presentation product but not nearly as good as PowerPoint and it would like to acquire

1401
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:06,340
Choirs who killed their own project I said if that's the way you want to go

1402
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,620
Want to go it's okay with me

1403
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:12,140
Another one of

1404
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:13,060
My greatest

1405
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:13,680
Mistakes

1406
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,660
Lakes which I have

1407
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:15,300
Mini

1408
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,870
Is when Microsoft

1409
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:18,920
Did the acquisition

1410
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:20,960
They wanted to do it all in stock

1411
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:25,350
So I was like you know Microsoft stock has way too much risk

1412
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,740
They could dump their stocking us at their pee

1413
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:34,210
Sahara we did an all-cash transaction and don't ask me to calculate what that cause

1414
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,830
That cause top of assets to

1415
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:36,510
It's too hurtful

1416
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:37,080


1417
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:39,130


1418
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:45,120


1419
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:51,160


1420
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:55,700


1421
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:57,610


1422
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:03,620
Shmoney

1423
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:09,620


1424
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:15,620


1425
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,120
The facts

1426
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,860


1427
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:20,340
40%

1428
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:22,200
Of the companies that have

1429
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,170
Change Pro

1430
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,540
Presidents in 18 months

1431
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,630


1432
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,320
Tell the young CEOs you're going to work hard and you're going to

1433
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:33,420
If you're lucky you're going to be successful

1434
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:39,760
Firing people is always hard for me

1435
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:44,610
That's a gut-wrenching thing to do if we got to go they got to go I'd rather

1436
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:50,720
The right people in back them then I'm the right idea

1437
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,630
An app to change the people

1438
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:58,660
Well nobody plans to do that but those are the facts

1439
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,710
So I operational principle that give him a shot help as much a

1440
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,160
As much as we can hopefully makes it

1441
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,240
Doesn't make it

1442
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:10,180


1443
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,130
Off with his head and Aunt for the next guy

1444
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,190


1445
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,870


1446
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:24,400
In 1984

1447
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,990
Cisco Systems with a two-person company

1448
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,870
Husband-wife team of Lambeau sack

1449
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:30,760
Sandy Lerner

1450
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,260
Cisco was a typical startup

1451
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,220
It was certainly run out of our house

1452
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:36,090
Number of

1453
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,610
Illustrious companies I think have that distinct

1454
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,030
Pisco

1455
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,220
Early evangelist

1456
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,320
For what would be called internet

1457
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,040
The Witcher 1980

1458
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:54,580
Was really just a jury-rigged network of computers use that universities and in the military

1459
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:55,570


1460
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:56,990


1461
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:03,380
A very big problem it allowed the computer systems to talk to each other

1462
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:06,840
First time

1463
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:11,140
Open the door to the development of an online world

1464
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:11,790


1465
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:12,550


1466
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:15,280
It was a desperately-needed product

1467
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,500


1468
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,520
Woodson and Cisco

1469
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:22,930


1470
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:27,940
We tried from the very beginning to to get funding

1471
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:28,900
We just

1472
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:30,110
Unsuccessful

1473
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,110
Not the first

1474
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:33,260
People to see it as

1475
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,860


1476
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:36,520
But they sought

1477
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,000
Before we did they turned it down

1478
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:39,990
They took the position that

1479
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:41,630
This wasn't a terrible business model

1480
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:43,590
I don't

1481
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,690
Taking their position I would have disagreed with that

1482
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:48,790
Physician

1483
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:50,890
The nuts

1484
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:51,900
Clear

1485
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:53,990
Different people

1486
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,180
Season differently

1487
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:58,510
The person who got us involved with c

1488
01:07:58,610 --> 01:07:59,210
Cisco

1489
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,510
You are probably the only person in North America who be willing to deal with these

1490
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,430


1491
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:07,480
The people

1492
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:08,310
At Cisco

1493
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,380
You were designing hard to get along with p

1494
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,680
Got the model right down

1495
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:16,750


1496
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:17,700
Do business with

1497
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:22,570
Totally intolerant of Amistad

1498
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:23,760
Made by anybody

1499
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,080


1500
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:26,730
Instrumental

1501
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:27,270


1502
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,360
I think so

1503
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,460
We were difficult to work with

1504
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,880
We were all very independent

1505
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,960
We were used to having our own way

1506
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,610
I'm certainly there's the mindset that has to go along with

1507
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,840
Years and years and years of people say

1508
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,390
You can't do what you say you're going to do and you can't

1509
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,490
Make money even if you could do it

1510
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:50,060
And that you're the wrong person to do it

1511
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:51,990


1512
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:52,760


1513
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,410
We bought a third of the company

1514
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:57,990
For 2.8 million dollars

1515
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:00,580
We had an agreement

1516
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:01,570


1517
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:06,640
You get a third of the company and we get a third of the company and we will fall

1518
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:07,230


1519
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:08,800
The people that run this company

1520
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:13,640


1521
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:15,610
None of us had ever built

1522
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,930
We understood that there was an enormous

1523
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:20,320
Need for

1524
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:22,410
For more structure and

1525
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:28,460
To bring in people that we had no way to reach

1526
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:31,620
New role

1527
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,360


1528
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:38,330
Recruited John morgridge a veteran several high-tech startups

1529
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:39,170
Cisco

01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,180


1531
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:42,870


1532
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:44,020
Was George Raft was he

1533
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,900


1534
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:46,750


1535
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,720
Quarter that I arrived

1536
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,580
We hired a shrink

1537
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,690
He eliminated fight

1538
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,360
Fighting in

1539
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:55,890


1540
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,490
Open the open hallways

1541
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:58,280


1542
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:58,820


1543
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,310
I actually had the

1544
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:06,030
Vice president engineering

1545
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:07,550
The sales

1546
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:09,440
Is President and why office

1547
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:15,400
We really did have a trench mentality

1548
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,910
This is not a good big company mentality

1549
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:21,000
Art kelsa free

1550
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,520
On the other hand I think that

1551
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,660
There was no one there in that original group who didn't

1552
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:29,570
Ardently loves that company

1553
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:33,820
Esysco Gru

1554
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,410
A culture Clash

1555
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,740
Developed between employees

1556
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:38,720
And the new hires

1557
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,150
Ultimately

1558
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,410
This class centered on Sandy Lerner

1559
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,950
She was definitely a strong personality

1560
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:51,560
And she definitely was the reason the company existed

1561
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,260
Sandy was incredible

1562
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:55,960
Peace in the Paw

1563
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,710
The puzzle

1564
01:10:58,490 --> 01:10:59,240
Done right

1565
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,150
For the customer

1566
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,860
Silicon Valley has not always been

1567
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:03,750
Spin the place where

1568
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,220
Where the customers thought of

1569
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:05,940
First

1570
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,310
Thing me

1571
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:09,750
In some places people thought of second or third

1572
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,710
Sandy was ensuring

1573
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,310
At the customer's stoto

1574
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,620
Unfortunately at the expense

1575
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,530
Some of the other major managers

1576
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,120
Very much alien needed

1577
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:29,290
The other people in the company

1578
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,170
Because

1579
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,610
No other than Monday hadn't been there

1580
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,530
Very long and

1581
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:36,660
You know I saw them

1582
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,080
Right way wrong way

1583
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:40,000
As a people I was trying to protect the

1584
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:40,880
Customers

1585
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,600
By your own admission she would detonate

1586
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,050
Usually in my office

1587
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:51,800
At Cisco

1588
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,460
Intervene the only woman a technical woman

1589
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,180
I think I was just very very frightening and

1590
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,270
There just wasn't a box for me

1591
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:00,970
And I think that

1592
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:03,300
I didn't make it

1593
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:04,960
Play G-Eazy

1594
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:06,190
For them to ignore me

1595
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:07,660
And I didn't make it

1596
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,940
Particularly easy for them to find a suitable box

1597
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,690


1598
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,660
The box that existed for women at the time

1599
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:19,150
Didn't seem to fit what I thought I would

1600
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,090
I was doing

1601
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:23,780


1602
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:25,620
Finally won

1603
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:26,430


1604
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:30,110
My assistant said the

1605
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,310
Conference room is

1606
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,170
Filled

1607
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,680
Cisco employees.

1608
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,610
Is demanding to see you

1609
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,480
All of the vice presidents of the company were in there

1610
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,460
They washed up Sandhill Road and said

1611
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,700
Either she goes or we off

1612
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,060
Terminator

1613
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:52,370
Or when quitting

1614
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:54,930
August

1615
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:01,670
And he called me and said you want me to handle this and I said no I'll handle it

1616
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:04,980
Sandy was retired

1617
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:09,250
First of all

1618
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,930
I'm headed out I was fired

1619
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:15,250
Sean

1620
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,510
Call the advance office

1621
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:20,040
He said

1622
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,410
You know

1623
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,170
You're now worth so much money it really doesn't make any sense

1624
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:27,100
Distance for you to work the

1625
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:27,810
Breakfast hard

1626
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,280
I think it's just

1627
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,200
A good idea if you just

1628
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:35,520
Retired

1629
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:37,640


1630
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,530
What do Heroes

1631
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:41,380
I think I have a

1632
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:43,170
Replacing

1633
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:45,050
In the company and I

1634
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,180
I don't really

1635
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:47,710
Once retire right now it was

1636
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,550
Pretty Posh yourself

1637
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:50,440


1638
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:51,270
And he said well

1639
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,190
I think today is your last day

1640
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,680
Mark Lenz office wear

1641
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:01,030
Linen for me that I

1642
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:02,840
Must surely be mistaken

1643
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,240
My Stockman's office well Lynnwood have to talk to John

1644
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:08,730
End.

1645
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,170
Came back and

1646
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:11,820
Walk out the door with me

1647
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,100
We never walk back in

1648
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:23,680
You know this idea that

1649
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,830
45% of Founders will be gone in 18 months

1650
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,810
In retrospect that was clearly the mindset

1651
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,770
Lenin like clearly

1652
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:36,460
Did not understand that that was the game that we were playing you know the first rule Venni game is to know that you're in when

1653
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:40,740
So unpleasant thing to do

1654
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:41,660
The fire anybody

1655
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:44,380
But it's clearly

1656
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:46,250
The Facts of Life

1657
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:54,560
Fake each of the one away with 170 million

1658
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:57,240
I don't know how people think

1659
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:01,170
Of what comes next after the first hundred and seventy million but

1660
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:02,660


1661
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:05,150
I don't think they've ever forgiven either of us

1662
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,530


1663
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:13,850
I was once asked did I start Cisco and make a whole bunch of money

1664
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:22,610
It's 45 South. We're probably could look at myself as a mirror in the morning I don't I think I've been a pretty

1665
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,770
Pretty good tool user

1666
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:30,060
Emma is a tool

1667
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:36,060


1668
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:42,060


1669
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:48,060


1670
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:54,060


1671
01:15:54,070 --> 01:16:00,060


1672
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:06,060


1673
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:07,880


1674
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:17,770
You know technology

1675
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,550
Keeps evolving in

1676
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:22,270
But ever since Leonardo DaVinci it's

1677
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:25,830
Evolving and it will continue to revolve

1678
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,720
Good times and bad times

1679
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:28,930
It will evolve

1680
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:29,840


1681
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,080
Venture capital is here to stay though

1682
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:40,880


1683
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:46,880


1684
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:52,880
My greatest satisfaction out of thinking back on the companies that I've helped start

1685
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:58,880
And help grow

1686
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:04,880
It's nice

1687
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:10,880
Nice to sit in the glow of your adulation but without the entrepreneur

1688
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:11,870
Is your nothing

1689
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:18,580
You have to have these real people with the ideas and their willingness to commit their life

1690
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:24,580
I don't think and I would not say that Silicon Valley is the result of good van

1691
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:27,580
Adventure capitalist not at all

1692
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:30,490
5 m is the main show Venture capitalism Aiden

1693
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:33,160
Sometimes people got lost we must have venture capital

1694
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:36,490
Will you selling Venture Capital unless you have on spinners

1695
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,390
But haven't been for the tribe against month

1696
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:41,360
Word Kleiner and I've

1697
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:47,460
Without

1698
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:53,460
Without venture-capital the future wouldn't happen nearly as quickly

1699
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:59,460
New companies are much better displayed in new technology that can extend an idea

1700
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:05,460
We would all have a lower standard living worldwide

1701
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:11,460
And it's early. You know everything from where country code 1

1702
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:17,460
One in the telephone system to the internet

1703
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:23,460
Adventure capital guy going in Turin to a bang

1704
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:29,460
Bank Renee says I want to start delivering mail by chest we going to Kleiner Perkins

1705
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:33,140
We want to make insulin and bacteria he goes okay

1706
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:39,250
Great things don't really come out of the status quo they come out of people with vision

1707
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:45,250
Drive to prove the difference underlying technology was there and

1708
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:51,250
There was nowhere for it to go until another venture capitals up here

1709
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:57,250
Thank Allah we got some money let's take a chance

1710
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,170


1711
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:00,540


1712
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,790
You need guys with new ideas about how to do think all these

1713
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:12,790
Do something build a company spread

1714
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:18,790
Educate their kids

1715
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:24,790
Do it

1716
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:30,790


1717
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:36,790


1718
